<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:30px;" > Quora Question Pairs </h1>

<h2> Problem Statement </h2>
- Identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already been asked. 
- This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered. 
- We are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not. 

<br>

<h2>1.1 Real world/Business Objectives and Constraints</h2>

- The cost of a mis-classification can be very high.

 - You would want a probability of a pair of questions to be duplicates so that you can choose any threshold of choice.

- No strict latency concerns.
<br>


<h2>1.2 Type of Machine Leaning Problem </h2>
<p> It is a binary classification problem, for a given pair of questions we need to predict if they are duplicate or not. </p>

-  ____freq_qid1____ = Frequency of qid1's
 - ____freq_qid2____ = Frequency of qid2's 
 - ____q1len____ = Length of q1
 - ____q2len____ = Length of q2
 - ____q1_n_words____ = Number of words in Question 1
 - ____q2_n_words____ = Number of words in Question 2
 - ____word_Common____ = (Number of common unique words in Question 1 and Question 2)
 - ____word_Total____ =(Total num of words in Question 1 + Total num of words in Question 2)
 - ____word_share____ = (word_common)/(word_Total)
 - ____freq_q1+freq_q2____ = sum total of frequency of qid1 and qid2 
 - ____freq_q1-freq_q2____ = absolute difference of frequency of qid1 and qid2 


<h2> 1.5 Preprocessing of Text </h2>

- Preprocessing:
    - Removing html tags 
    - Removing Punctuations
    - Performing stemming
    - Removing Stopwords
    - Expanding contractions etc.

<h2>1.7 Featurizing text data with tfidf weighted word-vectors </h2>

- After we find TF-IDF scores, we convert each question to a weighted average of word2vec vectors by these scores.
- here we use a pre-trained GLOVE model which comes free with "Spacy".  https://spacy.io/usage/vectors-similarity
- It is trained on Wikipedia and therefore, it is stronger in terms of word semantics.
